Thanks to the modern GPS, map, and logical design technology, we can navigate the map and other important areas of any big airport. This is a comprehensive guide on the <b>San Jose airport map</b> and offers step-by-step instructions for any journey through Silicon Valley's airport. </p>
            <h2>Navigational Cheat Sheet</h2>
            <p>Two Terminals: SJC has Terminal A and Terminal B. </p>
            <p>Terminal A Airlines: American, Delta, United, Spirit, Frontier, Volaris. </p>
            <p>Terminal B Airlines: Southwest, Alaska, ZIPAIR. </p>
            <p>International Travel: All international arrivals are processed in Terminal A. </p>
            <p>Getting around is free because 24/7 shuttle service connects both terminal and from these terminals you can also avail the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/car-rental.aspx"><b>car rental</b></a> and parking lots. You can walk between terminal post-security. </p>
            <h3>Scenario 1: You're Flying Out of SJC (Domestic) </h3>
            <p>Your journey starts the moment you approach the airport, and here is the guide where you navigate from the curb to the gate. </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Identify Your Terminal</h4>
            <p>You must check your boarding pass to identify your terminal and you can get dropped off, where you check your flight information to confirm your airline and its' designated terminal. Suppose your airline is American, Delta, Spirit, United, or Frontier. In that case, you need to head to Terminal A, and if you are flying with Southwest or <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/alaska-air.aspx"><b>Alaska Airlines</b></a>, then your destination is Terminal B. </p>
            <h4>Step 2: Parking or Drop-Off</h4>
            <p>For parking or drop-off, you can ask your driver to the departure level of your particular terminal. </p>
            <h3>Parking: </h3>
            <p>For Terminal A, Hourly Lot 2 is the closest garage. </p>
            <p>For Terminal B: Hourly Lots 3 &amp; 5 are the most convenient. </p>
            <p>For Budget/Long-Term: Park in the Economy Lot 1 and board the free shuttle bus. The shuttle will stop first at Terminal A, then Terminal B. </p>
            <h4>Step 3: Check-In and Security</h4>
            <p>Both terminals have ticketing and check-in counters on the second floor as per the San Jose airport map. Once you drop off any luggage, you will proceed to a centralized security checkpoint. SJC has TSA PrecheckÂ® and CLEAR lanes available at both terminals to expedite screening. </p>
            <h4>Step 4: Navigating to Your Gate</h4>
            <p>On the other hand, once you are through security then you need to check the departure area. Inside Terminal A, there are gates from 1 to 16, where you can find a vast, spacious concourse. If you want to enjoy coffee, tea, or a meal, then there are many good restaurants at San Jose airport that you can check out. The Club at SJC lounges are located near gates A8 and A15. </p>
            <p>Inside Terminal B, from Gates B17 to B35, you can enjoy a quick bite. Chick-fil-A is located between Gates 24 and 25. For a taste of California, you can try Sushi Boat near Gate 23. </p>
            <h2>Scenario 2: You're Traveling Internationally</h2>
            <p>The process of international travel has a few key distinctions. For departures, the process will be the same as for the domestic flight, and you need to check in at your airline's designated terminal (A or B). For arrival, the process is centralized, and all international flights, regardless of the airline, deplane and direct passengers to the international arrivals building, which is located adjacent to Terminal A. </p>
            <h2>Scenario 3: You're Picking Someone Up</h2>
            <p>SJC offers convenient options for meeting arriving passengers. </p>
            <h3>Step 1: Check the Flight's Arrival Terminal</h3>
            <p>You need to use the flight number you confirm which terminal your party will be arriving at. Remember, all international flights will exit from the International Arrivals Building next to Terminal A. Domestic arrivals will exit from their designated terminal's baggage claim on the ground floor. </p>
            <h3>Step 2: Wait in the Right Place</h3>
            <p>Cell Phone Waiting Areas: SJC has two free Cell Phone Waiting Areas where you can wait in your car until your party calls to say they are ready at the curb. One is located at 2470 Airport Blvd. </p>
            <p>The hourly parking for a more personal greeting, park in the hourly lots. For a more personal greeting, park in the hourly lots (Lot 2 for Terminal A, Lot 3 for Terminal B) and meet your passengers inside at their designated baggage claim carousel.
