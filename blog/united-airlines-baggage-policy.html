            <p class="text-justify">United Airlines is not expecting bags in which passengers installed any kind of lithium batteries in both carry-on and checked bags. You must remove lithium batteries from your bags if you want to board for the flight. Smart bags are also the big hurdle for the flyers to travel in United Air because smart bags in which the battery is not removable are not allowed in United and United Express Flights. </p>

If you do not want to face baggage-related problems on board then make sure the dimensions and weight of your baggage are according to the airline baggage policy. Passenger carry-on luggage must fit in the overhead bin space in the United Airlines (otherwise, it will count as the checked bag). </p>
