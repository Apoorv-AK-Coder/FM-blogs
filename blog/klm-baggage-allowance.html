            <h2>Carry-On (Hand) Baggage</h2>
            <p>You can travel with one or more items on board, depending on the travel class or ticket type, size, and weight limits. For the light-ticket holders, sometimes overhead bin space is limited, and they may be asked at no charge to check hand baggage at the gate.

            <h3>Checked (Hold) Baggage</h3>
