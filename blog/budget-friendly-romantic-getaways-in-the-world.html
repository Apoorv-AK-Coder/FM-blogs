                <h2>1. Santorini, Greece: A Mediterranean Vacation for Couples on a Budget</h2>
                <p>Sail along those Sinquinese iconic sunsets, their brilliant white architecture, and sparkling sapphire-blue waters, which spell romance. And although it is best known as the place where the elite have their holiday, it doesn’t mean you cannot travel there on a budget.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try the quieter guesthouses in Fira or Perissa instead of splurging on expensive hotels in Oia. Enjoy dining in family-run tavernas with authentic Greek dishes like moussaka and souvlaki at budget prices. </li>
                    <li>Take advantage of free opportunities like hiking the Fira-to-Oia trail, which gives breathtaking scenery, interesting experiences, and shooting views. Travelling off-season will give you the attraction with fewer crowds at cheaper prices. Use public buses. It is the cheapest way to travel between the towns and beaches. </li>
                    <li>Catch a sunset moment at Akrotiri Lighthouse, which is less crowded than others, or have a quiet day at Kamari Beach. </li>
                    <li>FaresMatch helps find <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/cheap-flights.aspx"><b>cheap flights</b></a>  so that the wonderful Mediterranean dream becomes an economical one, too.
