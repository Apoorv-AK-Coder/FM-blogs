                <p class="text-justify">As we love to travel from one place to another, we love to go to different countries and work or travel. For traveling, we often use airlines nowadays. People who frequently use airlines often face the loss of their belongings, suitcases, etc. So many of them know what to do exactly after their baggage is lost; but what about the individuals who don't travel through airlines frequently? </p>

                <p class="text-justify">They often get misguided, which may cause them another loss. Recently, this problem is going much more serious in <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-official-site-usa.aspx">Delta Airlines</a>. As you know, Delta Airlines is one of the best airlines in the world. </p>

                <h2>What should we do if our baggage is lost on delta airlines? </h2>

                <h3>File a report for your lost Delta baggage</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">While traveling through Delta Airlines, if you find that your luggage is missing, the first thing that should pop into your mind is to file a complaint. The traveler must file a passenger irregularity report (PIR) at the airline's desk at Delta Airlines. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The traveler should further provide detailed information about their lost delta baggage and needs to fill up their local address and contact information. They should not forget to get a claim number and a copy of the missing baggage report. We can also track our baggage status on the airline's website by mentioning the baggage claim number. </p>

                <h3>Get delayed baggage compensation</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">For those customers who paid Delta for a checked bag and had at least one Delta-operated flight, you may be eligible for a rebate in the form of an electronic travel voucher (ETCV) for the appropriate amount paid if you do not receive your bag within the first 12 hours from the reported delay. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">To be eligible for this rebate, you must have paid for the bag that has been delayed. CVs will be issued delta baggage compensation - for example, if you paid to check multiple bags, and one bag is delayed, you can expect an ETCV for the first bag fee. If both bags got delayed, you could expect an ETCV for both bags. </p>

                <h3>Report damaged baggage</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    If you feel your baggage was damaged during a flight, bring it to <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/requirements-for-filing-a-loss-of-baggage-with-delta-airlines.aspx">Delta Airlines baggage </a>office immediately after arrival. All damages must be evaluated in person by a delta representative at the baggage service office. A delta representative will provide a direction for you to fill out a damaged bag form if needed. It is important to report your claim in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h3>Stay calm and patient</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">If the airline does not follow any of the steps mentioned above, it is advised not to panic in that kind of situation. Do follow up with the airlines and file claim reports as requested. Don't let your complaint die. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">In the same kind of situation, don't expect immediate reimbursement. Give a few weeks for the processing of your claim and issuing payment. Calm your mind and try not to be angry with the customer service representatives as they are not the ones who lost your belongings. Be kind to them and try to cooperate. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">If they find your belongings, you should get them from lost and found delta airlines. It is becoming a concern what to do in these kinds of situations. These steps and requirements are important for anyone traveling on airlines. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Many will lose their patience which may affect them later on. So to prevent this, get a good check on your baggage at the airport to prevent these kinds of circumstances. Please cooperate with the services provided and obey further rules and regulations. </p>
