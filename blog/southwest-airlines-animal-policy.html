                <p>Nowadays, airlines are more flexible and generous for people travelling with their pets. It can be stressful for you, but Southwest Airlines provides passengers with a flexible and pet-friendly policy, allowing small animals to fly in the cabin. Whether you are bringing a dog, cat, or service animal, you must understand the airline rules, fees, and restrictions before booking the flight tickets. It is necessary to check <b>Southwest Airlines' animal policy</b> before booking the tickets if you want to fly with your pet.</p>
                <h2>1. Southwest Airlines Pet Policy – In-Cabin Travel</h2>
                <p>The airline only allows small pets in the cabin and does not permit the animals to travel in the cargo hold. Therefore, if you are flying with a pet, here are the key things to know: the allowed pets, pet carrier requirement, weight limit, and the number of pets. We classify each thing very simply.</p>
                <p>1. You can travel with only small cats and dogs and can travel in the cabin.</p>
                <p>2. You must also follow a pet carrier requirement: your pet must be in an approved pet carrier that fits under the seat in front of you.</p>
                <p>3. The weight limit of the pet and the carrier must be reasonable for in-cabin travel.</p>
                <p>4. Each passenger can bring one pet carrier with a maximum of two small animals.</p>
                <p><b>Allowed Pets:</b> Only small dogs and cats can travel in the cabin.</p>
                <p>5. There is a limit on the number of pets allowed per flight, so book early.</p>
                <h2>2. Southwest Airlines Pet Fee</h2>
                <p>Now, you need to understand the pet fee or pet fare in Southwest according to the airline's pet policy. Right now, the pet traveling fee is $95 each way per pet carrier. This fee is non-refundable and must be paid at the airport ticket counter. The airline does not allow pets to fly free, even for Rapid Rewards members.</p>
                <h2>3. Pet Carrier Guidelines</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, if you want to fly with Southwest, you must use an airline-approved pet carrier that meets the following requirements. Here are the rules to know -</p>
                <p><b>Size Limit:</b> The carrier must fit under the seat and not exceed 18.5" x 8.5" x 13.5" (L x H x W).</p>
                <p><b>Types of Carriers:</b> Both soft-sided and hard-sided carriers are allowed.</p>
                <p><b>Ventilation:</b> The carrier must have proper ventilation to keep the pet comfortable.</p>
                <p><b>Secure Closure:</b> The carrier must zip or close securely so the pet remains inside during the flight.</p>
                <p>Southwest sells branded pet carriers at the airport for $58, but you can also bring your own as long as it meets the airline's standards.</p>
                <h2>4. Southwest Airlines Emotional Support and Service Animal Policy</h2>
                <p>The airline no longer allows emotional support animals on flights. However, trained service animals are permitted under specific guidelines. As per the policy, only dogs are accepted as service animals, and the animals must be fully qualified to assist a person with a disability. Passengers traveling with service animals must complete a U.S. Department of Transportation. No extra fee is required for service animals.</p>
                <h2>5. Important Rules and Restrictions</h2>
                <p>Pets must always remain in the carrier during the flight, and only domestic flights allow pets. That means you can't fly internationally with pets on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-airlines.aspx"><b>Southwest Airlines</b></a>. No checked pets exist because the airline does not transport animals in the cargo, and no unaccompanied minors can travel with pets in the Southwest.</p>
                <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
