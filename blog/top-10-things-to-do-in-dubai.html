                <h2>1. Burj Khalifa: Reach for the Sky</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everybody who visits Dubai should see the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, with its 828 meters. A true marvel of architecture, it enables one to see things from a whole different view within the city, the desert, and outside of it. </li>
                    <li>It has the "At the Top" on the 148th floor, from where you can see the entire city from a 360-degree viewpoint. On a very clear day, you can see up to 95 kilometres from it, making it one of the most photographed points in the world. </li>
                    <li>For a truly decadent experience, however, try dining at Atmosphere, the world's highest restaurant, located on the 122nd floor. Refined ambience and a gourmet menu make this experience stand above the rest when considering the Burj Khalifa visit.</li>
                </ul><h2>2. Palm Jumeirah: The Eighth Wonder of the Earth</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing can be compared to the experience of skydiving above the Palm Jumeirah. This will allow you to free fall from 13,000 feet with the island's palm shape below, and the distance stretches out to the Arabian Gulf. </li>
                    <li>The views make the thrill of skydiving interesting. It gives a unique, rare view from above of one of the most famous man-made creations in the world. </li>
                    <li>Whether you have been skydiving for years or just feel like trying it for the first time, tandem jumps with certified instructors are safe and give you a live-wired moment. On the descent, you'll catch open views of Dubai's skyline, desert, and ocean, making it a once-in-a-lifetime action.</li>

                    <li>This desert around Dubai is an adventure lover's paradise, weaving adrenaline and serenity into one. A desert safari starts with that thrilling dune bashing session. </li>
                    <li>Climbing to the top and down the sides of formidable dunes with a 4Ã—4, the ride will just thrill you with the bumps and turns. When you're done with the excitement, settle in for a relaxing camel ride across the golden sands, which will bring you a peaceful view of its beauty. </li>
                    <li>You will also get to enjoy the sunset, as the desert turns out to be a magical scene, and then witness traditional Arabic entertainment such as belly dancing and fire shows. This evening's event will be perfected with an Arabic dinner served under the stars in a traditional Bedouin-type camp.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>This is a part of the city that really has some glimpse of history showing a bygone era with its traditional wind-tower houses, narrow alleys, and art galleries, which seem to be some oasis from the modernity around. </li>
                    <li>The Dubai Museum has fascinating exhibitions housed within Al Fahidi Fort, showing the striking contrast between Dubai as it was 50 years agoâ€”a small fishing villageâ€”and the superb global metropolitan city it is now. </li>
                    <li>Also, it is that place where you will find some very good cafes and restaurants for enjoying rich, authentic Arabic food.</li>
                </ul>
