            <p class="text-justify">When one plans to visit a new country, the first thing that comes to mind is deciding to choose airlines. There are so many best airlines in the US. However, to choose among them is little though. To help you sort this problem, we are listing down the top 8 best airlines which are not just providing low-cost tickets booking, but also provide lavish amenities and varieties of programs.</p>


            <h2 class="text-justify">Delta Airlines</h2>

            <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx">Delta Airlines</a>, while being placed No. 30 on the global list, is the most popular airline in the United States. It boasts one of the greatest fleets of any airline in the world, flying over 5,400 daily flights to 325 different destinations in 52 countries. Delta SkyMiles is a rewards program that is partnered with American Express and offers a variety of travel benefits. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Flying with Delta already implies you have a vast number of places to pick from. Apart from flying a large network, Delta also rates high in airport lounge access, cabin comforts, and most crucially, reliability. Delta has fewer delays and cancellations, so passengers can count on the airline to get them where they need to go. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Alaska Airlines</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">Alaska is much more than the state's nickname, "The Last Frontier." What began as a charter aviation business to transport people throughout Alaska has grown into one of the largest airlines in the United States. Starbucks coffee, Beecher's artisan cheese, Tim's Cascade potato chips, and beer from the Alaskan Brewing Company in Juneau are among the food and drink options available on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/alaska-airlines.aspx">Alaska flights</a>. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The airline's premium class is a comfortable step up from economy but far less expensive than first-class flight tickets, allowing you to enjoy advantages like more legroom and free alcoholic beverages without having to pay for a first-class ticket. The Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan is one of the few reward programs that still rewards you for the number of miles you fly. </p>


            <h2 class="text-justify">American Airlines</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">American Airlines is the largest airline in the world by fleet size and several passengers carried. American Airlines has a hub at practically every major airport in the United States. No airline's network is as extensive as American's, with flights to approximately 350 different domestic and foreign destinations. This is certainly one of the best airlines in the US. </p>
            <p>You may watch movies and episodes from Apple TV+ for free on your phone, tablet, or laptop, as well as language-learning apps to help you prepare for your overseas trip. Certain credit cards may help you quickly earn points on ordinary transactions that can be redeemed on American Airlines flights </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">JetBlue</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">JetBlue has long been associated with comfortable plane travel among frequent travelers. The Queens-based carrier is ranked No. 32 in the world and is the second-highest-rated American airline. JetBlue's destination network isn't as extensive as that of other major US airlines, with most flights serving domestic destinations as well as Mexico, the Caribbean, and a few towns in Central and South America. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">When it comes to rewards, the TrueBlue program allows up to seven travelers to pool their points and win awards more quickly. If you spend a certain amount in a calendar year, you'll be eligible for Mint seats on subsequent flights. Jetblue is suitable for passengers who want to treat themselves with the best <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/business-class-flights-deals.aspx">business class flight tickets</a>.</p>


            <h2 class="text-justify">Hawaiian Airlines</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">Hawaiian is one of the best airlines in the US. It maintains some of the greatest on-time departures, fewest cancellations, and baggage handling records among US airlines. It's also one of the few airlines that still serve complete meals to passengers in economy class, with the opportunity to upgrade for a fee. The menu emphasizes Hawaiian cuisine, with meals sourced from Hawaiian businesses. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The HawaiianMiles frequent flier program is a clear winner if you fly to Hawaii frequently. <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/hawaiian-airlines.aspx">Hawaiian Airlines </a>has been awarded a three-star rating for the quality of its airport and onboard products, as well as the service provided by its employees. Seats, IFE, amenities, food and beverages, cleanliness, and other aspects of the product are evaluated, while service is evaluated for both cabin and ground crew. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">United Airlines</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">
                Besides its main hub at Chicago O'Hare Airport (ORD), United maintains seven other hubs across the country, including San Francisco (SFO), Houston (IAH), and Newark (EWR) airports, providing seamless travel with minimal layovers. United also travels to over 110 overseas locations, with the Star Alliance, of which United is a founding member, expanding the network even further.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">Basic Economy seating is the least expensive, but even a little upgrade to standard Economy provides several valuable benefits, such as the ability to select your seat and bring a carry-on bag. You could buy the best business class<a href=" https://www.faresmatch.com/united-tickets.aspx"> flight tickets </a>on this airline. </p>

            <h2 class="text-justify">Southwest Airlines</h2>

            <p class="text-justify">This airline has expanded to become the country's largest domestic carrier. <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/southwest-airlines.aspx">Southwest Airlines</a> has established itself as one of the most economical ways to travel across the United States because of cost-cutting measures including deleting business class seats and avoiding the "hub system." </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Southwest's economy class tickets provide several perks, including two free checked bags and free flight changes up to 10 minutes before departure. The Southwest Rapid Rewards program is one of the finest for domestic travel if you don't fly internationally frequently. You'll get a free roundtrip flight for every eight trips you take. </p>
