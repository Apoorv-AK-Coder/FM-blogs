            <h2>
                Benefits of the United- Emirates partnership
            </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">The most highlighted aspect of this partnership is the Dubai to Newark/New York flight. This air passage has never been utilized so beneficially by other airline providers. With this partnership, frequent flights are to be expected from both of these companies. United has promised 500 Airbus and Boeing aircraft to their fleet. This addition means that passengers can be sure to attend important business meets and ensures fast traveling. In-plane services include free wifi and Bluetooth, so passengers can now tune in to their favorite digital media while flying through the air. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">Membership owners of such services as Milegeplus of United Airlines will have added benefits. Chase Ultimate Rewards is another system of membership that this United-Emirates Partnership provides. This membership allows passengers to transfer their destination from one company to the other, namely from Emirates to United, and other flight partners in partnership with United Airlines!  Here are the benefits that the passengers are likely to enjoy in a tabulated form: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>New Fly <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/emirates-flights-to-dubai.aspx">Emirates flights</a> to three popular hubs in the USA: Chicago, San Francisco, and Huston. </li>
                <li>Two hundred new airports are now reachable through this partnership</li>
                <li>Passengers can shift their flights from Emirates to their partners in the USA, without paying extra, as long as the destinations are the same, through a method called codeshare</li>
                <li>The main attraction of this partnership is the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-flights-to-dubai.aspx">Dubai-US flights</a>. Passengers can fly directly, without having to disembark and change flights, from Dubai to New York. This service is not yet scheduled, but the two companies have promised that they will begin from 2023</li>
                <li>Passengers can access the lounge of either of the two companies in this partnership. In effect, a passenger who has an Emirates ticket can also access the lounge space of United Airlines. </li>
                <li>Free Wifi services both in the lounge and onboard</li>
                <li>Free Bluetooth support</li>
                <li>A thoroughly revises rewards program, including a mile redemption policy and codeshare </li>
            </ul>


            <h2>Fly Emirates flights in the USA</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Fly Emirates is a United Arab Emirates company, headquartered in Dubai. This airline company has 150 destinations under its sleeves worldwide in more than 70 countries. Its hub is in Dubai. Emirates has multiple partnerships with other airline companies. Emirates' partnership with United is the company's gateway to cater to the American market. Because of this Emirates-United partnership, passengers are sure to get more benefits. The benefits have already been mentioned in this article. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">It is, however, interesting to see how these two rival companies - the Emirates and the United, came into a partnership. Because of this business deal, United will start flights from Emirates' chief hub-Dubai, connecting Newark/New York. The codeshare agreement is another of the most important things that a passenger may look at because, with this feature, people can swap their seats between these two providers, provided that the destinations are the same.  </p>

            <p class="text-justify">A thorough regulation is also expected out of this partnership. To compare the airfares, FaresMatch is just the website one needs. To use this website, one has to follow these steps: </p>

            <h2>United Airlines flights</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">United Airlines, Inc. is an American airline company called United. The company has its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. United Airlines has a vast network of flights, with destinations to both domestic and international hubs. It has eight hundred and fifty-one aircraft in its fleet and is the third largest airline company concerning its fleet size. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">United Airlines lists imminent subsidiaries, such as Chelsea Food Services, Covia LLC, United Vacations, United Cogen, etc. The reputation of this company is terrific when it comes to flights to America. On September 14, 2022, United Airlines made public its partnership with Gulf- country luxury airlines company - Fly Emirates. Out of this partnership, passengers will receive the most for their buck spent, but the sources are yet to strongly comment on what new features will be included. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">A critical quirk this partnership has resulted in is the mile redemption policy seen in low-cost carriers. For one mile flown, the Emirates-United partnership is expected to give one mile free. The mile redemption policy has, however, yet to be confirmed. The Emirates-United partnership is also providing Chase Ultimate Rewards. </p>


            <h2>
                What is Chase Ultimate Rewards?
            </h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Chase Ultimate Rewards is a rewards program that members of Chase's credit card can avail of. This reward system is highly valued for traveling purposes, as the accumulated points can pay for travel expenses. These points can be earned by spending money on Chase credit cards. Generally, $1 redeems 1 point. </p>

            <p class="text-justify">The accumulated points can then be added to purchase/use the following: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Travel</li>
                <li>Gift cards</li>
                <li>Technological purchases: Apple products can be bought using these credit points. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-justify">For traveling purposes, the points can be redeemed in two ways: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>By booking hotels and flights through the Chase credit card </li>
                <li>By transferring accumulated Chase points to Chase's partner airlines and hotels. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-justify">Chase Ultimate Rewards for Emirates-United flights: Passengers with bona fide Chase credit cards can redeem their credit points to purchase Emirates-United Services. These credit points can be used to enjoy hotel stays and flight rewards. Skyward Miles is a mile redemption program of Fly Emirates. Chase Ultimate Rewards can be transferred to Skyward Miles, and thus passengers can use these services. </p>




            <p class="text-justify">Emirates-United partnership is a milestone in the Gulf-American Airlines history. But for passengers, this is a convenient thing. Traveling from Dubai to New York has been a very tedious and expensive experience, but with this partnership, some of these issues will be addressed. More <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/flights.aspx">flights</a> and excellent in-plane services mean that passengers need neither wait nor feel bored on their journeys. Passengers with Chase credit cards can use these services to the fullest. </p>
