The raw to medium-rare pink meat is thinly sliced and is often piled atop a roll with onions and a sauce. </p>

The buttery white flesh is medium to firm and has a mild flavor, i.e. little sweet and salty. You can find it prepared in various ways in many restaurants across the state, from grilled toasted to steam. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">It is made from whiting caught in the Atlantic Ocean, and lake trout are covered in crushed crackers or cornmeal. It is fried until crunchy and golden and served hot atop a slice of white bread. Hot sauce can be optional. In and around Baltimore, restaurants called Lake trout, Lake trout 2, and Lake trout 3 are all excellent places to try this food. </p>
