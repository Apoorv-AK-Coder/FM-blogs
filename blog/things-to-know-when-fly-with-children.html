                <h2 class="text-justify">Before Your Flight</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Choose <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/">Cheap Flights </a>and seats which minimize disruptions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A successful air journey for kids starts before you take the flight. Start by ensuring that the dates you select for your flight match your child's timetable. </li>
                    <li>Planning a flight for naptime is a better option than waiting for them to be quiet during times when they tend to be more active. </li>
                    <li>(Speaking of nap times, here's a selection of the most comfortable and cosy pillows for kids to travel with ...something that you can't take a flight without!) </li>
                    <li>If you are planning to take a flight in the morning be sure to prepare your child to be successful by ensuring they get the best night's sleep before the scheduled time. </li>
                    <li>If you are considering a red-eye flight take a look at how your child is able to fall asleep in a different and unfamiliar sleeping space. </li>
                    <li>The most undesirable thing to have to happen is screaming children or hyperactive kids while other passengers try to relax. </li>
                    <li>When you are reserving seats, ensure that you're sitting with your kids. </li>
                    <li>The majority of airlines offer you to pick seats in advance which ensures that adults and children are able to sit as family. If this option isn't available, you might have to pay an extra fee for this essential feature. <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/delta-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx">Delta Airlines Booking </a>is one of the finest choice to fly with kids. </li>
                    <li>Additional planning tips A seat on the rear of the plane places you in close proximity to the bathroom and flight attendants to make things easier. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-justify">If you are able, place children far enough away from the aisles since it can be extremely risky. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Toes are prone to being trampled over, or hands that are tiny are caught when the cart with food and drinks moves by. Hot liquids can also be at risk of spilling by the trolley.Don't forget that there aren't all airlines equally when it comes to flying with children.It is essential to know the best airlines for flying with children and to also know the specific child and infant flight policies. <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/united-airlines-flights-reservations.aspx">United Airlines Flights </a>are also good to fly with kids. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">2. Review security procedures for airports. </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">It is essential that kids be aware of security and airport procedures prior to boarding the plane.Reviewing these procedures prior to time can help reduce the fear of the unknown as well as making all participants aware of expectations expected from them.Discuss the check-in procedure along with the necessity of patience during long lines.Make it clear that security screening is a crucial step in flying. In the same way, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) personnel are on hand to ensure safety for everyone on the ground. </p>
                <h3>Points to Be Noted: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Review with your child about what their 'job' will be during security at the airport. </li>
                    <li>Instruct children to take responsibility for their own personal carry-on items. </li>
                    <li>Define the process of passing through metal detectors removing the shoes and jackets (kids older than 12 years old)) and placing their items on the belt that moves. </li>
                    <li>Inform children that electronic devices and food items must be delivered to security separately. </li>
                    <li>Then, ensure that the children aren't forgetting to dispose of any bottle juice or water that they might have consumed. </li>
                    <li>Planning tip: Download an extensive TSA travel checklist that you can review here. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">3. Let each child have their own luggage</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To ensure a smooth flight ensure that each child has an individual backpack with a carry-on bag. </li>
                    <li>I would suggest an unbag or the rolling suitcase as backpacks can be stored at child's feet and make them accessible during flights. </li>
                    <li>Backpacks can also enable children to keep their hands free while traveling through the airport. </li>
                    <li>Let children help pick the things, activities and snacks that they bring in their suitcases. It should contain a blanky as well as a stuffed animal or another comfort item. </li>
                    <li>Then, ask your children to consider whether your bags will permit them to stroll through the airport. </li>
                    <li>If they find it excessively heavy, then they should consider their options and take items out when needed. (This will prevent Mom or dad from ending having to carry it.) </li>
                    <li>Click the image below to download your family's free packing list that is printable and customizable! </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">4. Do layers, skip laces</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Be prepared for radically changing temperatures while flying. To avoid this, dress your children in comfy layers, with no zippers, buttons or anything else that may hinder them from reaching the bathroom on time. The same principles apply to shoes. Do not tie your shoes if you can because it reduces the time and effort required to take shoes off and on during security checkpoints and rest time. In reality, when it comes to planning a travel with children dress in layers and not having to deal with the hassle knots in shoes is always a great option! </p>
                <p>At the Airport</p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">5. Start early</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the most effective ways to fly with kids is to start off with a great start by getting to the airport before. </li>
                    <li>Waiting, lines, and crowds times are constantly changing, therefore this is one those situations in which I recommend to be cautious by arriving early and in-time. </li>
                    <li>Verify the status of your flight prior to departing for the airport. Adhere to the airport's recommended timings for arrival. </li>
                    <li>In general, it is suggested arriving at airport two hours before domestic flights and 3 hours prior to international flights. </li>
                    <li>Remember, you're in kid time, so make sure to plan for bathroom trips that are unexpected and other deviations. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">6. Be aware of the place you park when you arrive</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    If you're driving to the airport using your personal vehicle, consider whether you will park at the airport or offsite in the shuttle lot.
                    Another option is to spend the night prior to leaving at the hotel that has a park-n'-fly option.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Compare costs and the ease of use.
                    Personally, we prefer to take advantage of an offsite shuttle that is located in the same location every time we travel. We've grown accustomed to the regular shuttle schedule with a friendly and helpful staff as well as adequate security.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Once you are comfortable with a specific parking location, make it your primary choice every time to make sure you have a comfortable and relaxing travel experience. </p>
                <p>Write down the space and level that you have parked in. You will also be familiar with the steps you'll need to complete to arrange for airport pickup when you return home. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">7. Keep travel documents stored and easily accessible</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Another suggestion for flying with kids is to choose an adult (Mom or Dad) to take charge of all family reservation and travel identification. </li>
                    <li>Keep your entire family's travel records easy to access and organised by keeping them together in a passport case. </li>
                    <li>For example, if I will provide the airline agent five passports My husband is accountable to load the baggage onto the scales and ensuring it is properly tagged. This is the routine we follow each time we go to the airport. </li>
                    <li>Tell the kids in advance that this is a chance to be quiet until the check-in procedure. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">8. Discuss who's in which seat prior to taking off on the plane</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Who's seated by whom? Who is the one who gets the window seat? </li>
                    <li>There's nothing quite like taking off on an airplane and watching children begin to debate these topics on the plane aisle. </li>
                    <li>This may seem simple, but it is important to discuss the seating area each person will be in advance so that there are no arguments and to keep everyone calm. </li>
                    <li>It is also important to ensure that everyone takes their seats, and keep the flow of passengers flowing. (The same is true for the return flight.) </li>
                    <li>Beware of the spread of germs</li>
                    <li>Clean up 'your area' and the kids' area as soon as you reach your seats. It is possible to do this by carrying a travel size bag of Clorox disinfectant wipes to keep in your carry-on bag that you have readily available. </li>
                    <li>Make sure that everyone in your household wash the headrests, armrests, tray table, and the seat belt buckle. </li>
                    <li>While we cannot travel in a bubble of sterility I'm willing to take every precaution to prevent contracting illnesses when traveling. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">10. Prepare for pressure from the air. </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Another tip to fly with children is to talk with them about how variations in pressure could cause their ears to experience "like they're plugged or popping".</li>
                    <li>Once you've gotten through security, buy bottles of water that the children sip throughout the ascent and descent of the plane. This is one of the worst moments for ear pain. </li>
                    <li>Chewing gum or sucking on candy or yawning are all methods to stimulate swallowing, which can ease the discomfort or pain caused by pressure on the ear. </li>
                    <li>A second tip to plan If you are aware beforehand that your child is susceptible to experiencing ear pains when flying, give them ibuprofen or acetaminophen 30 minutes prior to takeoffs as well as landings. Similar to motion sickness medication. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">11. Use good flying etiquette</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>While it's not your responsibility to be a good host to everyone on the plane, there are certain responsibilities as parents flying with our children. </li>
                    <li>The common courtesy of not letting kids play with the seats in the front of them, pull hair, run in the aisles or show bad manners are extremely crucial. </li>
                    <li>As parents, we're accountable for the supervision of our children in ensuring they're not disrupting another person's space or causing any inconvenience. </li>
                    <li>If you are attentive to your children's needs, not just will children remain happy and relaxed during the flight and on the plane, but other passengers will too. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">12. Just enough to pack</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I recommend that you bring just enough for the plane, making sure that you pack the basic necessities. </li>
                    <li>Over packing can cause anxiety in keeping everything in order and organized, as creating additional stress the need to transport and store a heavy carry-on. </li>
                    <li>The list of items that should be packed for the trip: </li>
                    <li>One Comfort item for every one child. If it's a baby pacifier, ensure you bring several in event that the first one gets damaged or disappears. </li>
                    <li>Cleansers, wipes Pull-ups, diapers, and wipes. In the event that your kid is potty training or has not yet been potty-trained fully think about having them wear Pull-Ups during the flight as well as bringing an extra set of clothes in the event in the event of an accident. One diaper for every one hour during travel suggested. </li>
                    <li>Smartphone and tablets packed with your child's most loved games, films, and TV shows. </li>
                    <li>Sized for children, these headphones</li>
                    <li>Art equipment: Crayons and blank paper. </li>
                    <li>Water: bought once by security. </li>
                    <li>Foods that are low in sugar and mess-free: Pretzels, crackers, apple slices, string cheese carrots, the granola bars are all good choices. </li>
                    <li>Medicines include prescriptions for motion sickness medicines such as antacids, pain relief and the use of fever reducers. </li>
                    <li>Napkins, plastic bags, and a new set of clothes for children who are susceptible towards motion sickness. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">13. Bring snacks to the party. </h2>
                <p class="text-justify">This suggestion to fly with kids is so vital that I have to mention it over and over again! According to me, snacks are the number. 1 way to keep kids at ease and content during flights. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Bring snacks from home an excellent way to cut down on the costs related to food purchases at the airport or aboard. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Another tip for planning Do not forget to pack a variety of snacks for your return trip back home! I usually pack two separate Ziplock bags of snacks: one for the journey 'there as well as one to take home for the return journey. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">14. Do not travel with either an iPad or tablet</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">The majority of parents have good intentions regarding their children and restricting their time on screens. Don't let flying with your children be an exception to this policy However. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Fill your child's tablet or pad with music, games as well as TV shows and films to keep them entertained the longest time possible. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">This is a fantastic on-the-go activity that keeps the attention of children for long periods of time. Take them with you when you travel. in a size that is suitable for kids so that passengers don't get disturbed. </p>
                <h2 class="text-justify">15. Bring surprises</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even with the best intentions, your children are likely to become restless. </li>
                    <li>The ideal way to reduce boredom during a flight with your kids is to offer them some surprise experiences along the journey (that you've carefully thought about in advance). </li>
                    <li>Special treats, a brand-new game or a special trinket with well-planned intervals, when the "Are we there yet?" questions are coming up. </li>
                    <li>Don't give them each surprise in one go But, make sure to keep a few extras for your return journey home. </li>
                    <li>
                        Another tip for planning Check out my entire article on creating activity bags to keep your kids entertained and entertained on any upcoming flight.
                    </li><li>Although originally intended for a road trip they can easily be adapted for flying with children instead. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="text-justify">16. Maintain your calm</h2>

                    <li>Make sure to tire them out prior to taking off for the airport. </li>
                    <li>Pick evening flights. </li>
