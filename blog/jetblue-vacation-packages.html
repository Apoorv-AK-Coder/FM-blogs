                <h2>JetBlue Airlines</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">JetBlue Airlines is the American region's low-cost airline and the seventh largest airline in North America. It was established in 1999 by David Neeleman. The airlines attracted their customers with their <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/low-cost-flights-booking-deals.aspx">low-cost tourism packages</a>. And now they have announced the $300 discount for the vacation packages. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">However, this is not the first time they have announced a limited deal; even they announced it last year (2021). As the name suggests, this deal will be limited to a few days. But this year, 2022, they have started this deal from June to September 2022. </p>

                <h3>Dates to be remembered</h3>

And the customers have to use code <b>"SUMMER22"</b> to avail of the benefits. (Please be careful with the caps and numbers!) </p>

                <p class="text-justify">The sale offers a 300-dollar discount for the <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/blog/jetblue-vacation-packages.aspx">JetBlue Vacations</a> flight and hotel package or the flight and cruise package.

                <p class="text-justify">But the sale underlined the most important condition: the sale will be applicable if the customer chooses at least the packages worth 2000 dollars. Customers will receive the $300 offer if they choose the 2000-dollar flight travel package. </p>
