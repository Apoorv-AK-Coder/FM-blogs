                <p class="text-justify">To somebody who has never glimpsed a desert, it's hard to express the emotion of approaching one. What you witness is a drying landscape, browning land, and the gradual disappearance of trees, plants, and indications of life. Before long, the dunes come out of nowhere. You must do <b>safari planning </b>before making a move there.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">A vast expanse of golden waves that appears to have neither beginning nor finish. It's easy to exhibit photos and write words, but it's more difficult to convey a feeling. Perhaps it's one of those things that you just have to witness for yourself, like seeing the ocean for the first time. Sahara is amongst the <b>best destinations for safari</b>.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">For many visitors, safari travel can be an once-in-a-lifetime experience if they avoid making some typical blunders while on the road. You can avoid blunders with the aid of basic Safari planning. </p>

                <h2>Top 10 tips to consider for safari tours: </h2>

                <h3 class="text-justify">1. Insurance for travel</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Take out travel insurance as soon as your vacation plans are confirmed. Choose a policy that includes cancellation, medical illness, emergency evacuation, and hospitalization costs. Make a note of your travel insurance emergency phone numbers as well as your policy number and data to keep it while you are on a Safari trip. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">2. Plan a perfect airline booking for safari</h3>
                <p class="text-justify"><a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/major-airlines.aspx">Airline booking</a> for safari tours needs to be planned as soon as possible. The later youâ€™ll do it, the more expensive it will cost you. Many airlines provide coupons and discounts on <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/deals.aspx">deals of Safari tickets bookings</a>.  You can even take help from online travel agents like Fares Match to <b>plan a cheaper Safari travel booking </b>.</p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">3. Dress accordingly</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Visiting the desert isn't the same as going on a vacation to the city or the countryside. The Sahara safari is characterized by high daytime temperatures and low nighttime temperatures. Sweating, in other words, can contribute to dehydration and sunstroke. To avoid this, make sure you're dressed in light, loose, and comfortable clothing. Don't forget to cover the regions of your body that are most susceptible to sun exposure, such as your head. Finally, wear light-colored clothing rather than dark-colored apparel since light-colored clothing does not absorb as much heat as dark-colored clothing does. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">4. Make sure you have adequate water</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Even if you're not a big drinker, you'll need to do so in the desert. The issue isn't thirsting, but rather excessive water loss from the body due to sweating. It's a good idea to keep a few extra bottles of water in your car or bus so that you can rely on them in an emergency. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">5. Make certain you possess a survival kit with you </h3>
                <p class="text-justify">A rope, a knife, a compass, a lighter, a first-aid kit, an insulated blanket, and a torch are all included in a survival kit. These supplies may go unused in the city, but nothing else you brought will be of help if you find yourself amid a desert, dying of hunger, under a scorching sun of over 30 degrees Celsius, and unable to take shelter under a parasol. Consider them while doing safari planning. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">6. Put on the proper footwear</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    When walking in the desert, it's best to wear shoes that protect your ankles and have adequate room on the inside. If you have an excellent pair of trainers, that will be enough. Also, make sure your shoes aren't too tight because this will assist you to retain more water. Don't buy footwear that will let sand in, will break, or will let too much heat in through the soles.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-justify">7. Beware of Poisonous cacti</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Cacti make up the vast bulk of them. Many tourists want to eat cactus fruit and get up close and personal with it. You can accomplish the former with little risk, but you should be aware that cacti frequently scatter venomous spines in their surroundings, which can penetrate your skin and cause illnesses. Even though they appear to be incredibly appealing to us, you should be aware of them. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">8. Take care of your belongings</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">It's primarily a matter of common sense when it comes to personal safety and security. So, just like you would in any major city at home, take the following precautions when on safari planning. Carry only small amounts of cash. Carry your cash in a money bag hidden beneath your shirt, together with your passport and other travel documents. Keep it hidden in your camera bag or knapsack (which should remain in sight at all times). Also, keep your passport, plane tickets, and cash in a secure location. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">9. Vehicle Selection</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Make intelligent vehicle selections. Your great safari planning can be ruined by a poor vehicle selection. If you're renting a car, make sure it's a comfy and large vehicle. You might choose the air-conditioned ones for a more pleasant journey. Open vehicles that are specifically designed for safari travel may be preferred at times. When selecting a vehicle, two aspects must be considered: comfort and correct seating arrangements to ensure a good view. </p>

                <h3 class="text-justify">10. Enjoy</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Feel a part of the desert and journey to the One Thousand and One Nights tales, as well as the stories we tell our children, in which characters were duped by the desert's power. The wonders of the desert are part of our culture in stories, fantasies, and legends, and there are only a few lucky countries close enough to provide the opportunity to experience them. So don't forget to enjoy the safari to the fullest. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">So now you're aware of your responsibilities. Make your way to the desert. Embark on a Safari planning adventure! It'll be the most enjoyable experience you've ever had. The desert, after all, is a region of opposites, and nowhere is this more evident than in the Sahara safari, the world's largest desert. It's a lonely location with a lot of heat. Music, stories, civilizations, and customs all have a place here.
