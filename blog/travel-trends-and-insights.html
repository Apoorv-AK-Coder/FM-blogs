                <h3>3. Flexible Booking Options</h3>

                <p>With travel becoming more affordable, multi-city itineraries are trending. Many travellers are combining leisure and work trips, taking advantage of extended stopovers offered by airlines.</p>
                <h3>5. Rise of Subscription Services</h3>
                <p>Right now, one more popular trend is flight subscription plans. These plans offer many perks to the passengers, such as the ability to choose a set number of flights per year or a flat fee, and they are gaining users' attention.</p>
