                <li>Cheap Alternative Airports: If coming from a major city like Anchorage, consider flying to less-known airports nearby, like Fairbanks or Juneau that may have lower cost rates.</li>
                <li>When the price drops on flights intended for a desired destination, many people receive information through fare alerts offered by several travel websites and even airlines.</li>
                <li>Check out Low-Cost Airlines: Some low-cost carriers may have cheaper air tickets going to Alaska, but be informed about other expenses, then calculate all travel costs on the website at once.</li>
                <li>During off-peak travel periods, avoid traveling during peak seasons such as summer or major holidays, characterized by high airfares. Instead, shoulder months such as late spring and early autumn can be considered for better price offers.</li>
