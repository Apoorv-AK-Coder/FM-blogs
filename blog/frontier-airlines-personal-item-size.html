                <p>People who are thinking of flying with Frontier Airlines but are not sure about the baggage policy and size rules are in the right place. Here is everything you need to know about the baggage policy and personal items. This blog is all about the personal items in <a href="https://www.faresmatch.com/frontier-airlines.aspx"><b>Frontier Airlines</b></a>, and through this blog, you can know the size requirements and other rules. <b>Frontier Airlines personal items size</b> is 14 inches x 18 inches x 8 inches, and you should follow this policy and size requirement. Then it is good for you to avoid any other extra charges. The airline is known for the low-cost fares and this is the reason the size and fee are quite strict of the airline.</p>
                <h2>What Is a Personal Item on Frontier Airlines?</h2>
                <p>A personal item is a small piece of luggage or accessory that passengers are allowed to bring onboard without any additional fee. This is not the type of checked or carry-on luggage, and your item must meet the strict size requirements to qualify as a free item.</p>
                <h3>Examples of personal items include:</h3>
                <p>A purse or handbag</p>
                <p>A laptop bag</p>
                <p>A small backpack</p>
                <p>A diaper bag</p>
                <p>A tote bag</p>
                <h2>Frontier Airlines Personal Item Size Policy</h2>
                <p>Frontier Airlines has specific dimensions for what qualifies as a personal item. Your item must not exceed the following dimensions:</p>
                <p>14 inches x 18 inches x 8 inches</p>
                <p> (35 cm x 46 cm x 20 cm). This size includes any handles, wheels and straps, and before leaving for the airport, you must measure your bag carefully to ensure it is fit or not.</p>
                <h2>How to Measure Your Item?</h2>
                <p>If you want to avoid surprises at the airport then there are some steps to measure your item. First of all, you need to measure from all sides and use a tape measure to measure the height, depth of the bag and width, including any other stuff like handles and wheels. You need to compare against the dimensions and ensure the bag's total dimensions fit within Frontier's 14” x 18” x 8” allowance. Sometimes, fully packed bag or unpacked bag dimensions are different. Therefore, check the fully pack bag.</p>
                <h2>Tips to Maximize Your Item</h2>
                <p>As we know about the fact that personal items are free, and you need to maximize the use of this allowance. You must choose the small backpack and check the best brands of backpacks for extra space, and there are many travel-friendly backpacks brands right now in the market. You can also use the packing cubes to organize personal items efficiently, and by using the packing cubes, you can save space. Also, make sure that you layer wisely because bulky items like jackets and hoodies cover more space.</p>
                <h2>What Happens If Your Item Exceeds the Size Limit?</h2>
                <p>On the other hand, if your personal item size is exceeded, then you have to pay the fee on the personal item size if the item size exceeds the airline rules. Frontier’s carry-on and checked baggage fees can be substantial, especially if paid at the gate. Avoid these charges by adhering to the personal item size guidelines.</p>
                <h2>Frontier Airlines Bag Sizer Tool</h2>
                <p>Yes, there is a tool at the airport that you can use to verify the size of your item. If your bag does not fit, then you are required to pay the extra fee on the spot, and this tool helps you to do the ultimate test for complaints.</p>
                <h3>Why Does Frontier Enforce Strict Personal Item Policies?</h3>
                <p>The airline operates on a low-cost model, which means they offer affordable base fares but charge for extras like carry-on bags, checked luggage, seat selection, and even onboard refreshments. Their strict personal item policy is part of this approach, helping keep ticket prices low for budget-conscious travellers.</p>
