                <h3>Step 7: Prepare for Your New Flight</h3>
                <p>Once the flight changes are confirmed which done by you, then you can plan your trip accordingly, check-in for your flight 24 hours before the departure and review the baggage and other travel requirements for smooth travel.</p>
